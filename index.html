									<h2>Hobbies</h2>
									<p>Soccer is the sport I spent most of life playing, which gave me the chance to lead as a captain for multiple years and travel to rival states focusing on success. Additionally, outdoor activities such as biking and hiking are enjoyable, and learning how to cook unique foods and bingeing shows takes up some of my time inside.</p>
